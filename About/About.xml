	<description>An A16 update of ItchyFlea's Extended Woodworking. Each tree type now produces a unique wood specific to that tree. These new wood types can be converted into lumber and, like the base game metals, can be used to construct various furnitures, buildings, and other items which are designated as 'Woody' in the stuff category. Requires Expanded Woodworking and Better Terrain.</description>
